  \item{Description}{Character. Description of the specific pathway, including KEGG identifiers.}
  \item{Count}{Numeric. Number of genes associated with the pathway.}
  \item{\%}{Numeric. Percentage of total genes related to the pathway.}
  \item{PValue}{Numeric. Statistical p-value indicating the significance of the pathway's enrichment.}
  \item{Genes}{Character. List of gene identifiers associated with the pathway, separated by commas.}
  \item{List Total}{Numeric. Total number of genes in the list being analyzed.}
  \item{Pop Hits}{Numeric. Number of pathway hits in the population.}
  \item{Pop Total}{Numeric. Total number of genes in the population.}
  \item{Fold Enrichment}{Numeric. Measure of the fold increase in pathway representation.}
  \item{Bonferroni}{Numeric. Bonferroni-adjusted p-value for multiple comparisons correction.}
